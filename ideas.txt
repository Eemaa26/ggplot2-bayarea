  * if want you want to do doesn't fit in the grammar, very hard (but I'd argue most of the time if this is true you are probably doing something wrong)

From Charlotte:

so talk about ggplots strengths versus the other systems. explain the
grammar just enough to understand how to construct a plot.  maybe a
bit about what form your data should be in (and a plug for plyr). and
then you need lots of examples that highlight ggplot's strengths.  or
maybe some cool examples from other people (like learnr).

or maybe the most frequently asked questions on the mailing list.
like: how do I do multiple plots on one page? how do i make the
colour/size/shape mapping exactly how i want it?  how do i use two
datasets in one plot? (or how do i make a reproducible example?)
