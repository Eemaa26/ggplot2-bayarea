Housing crisis

Aim: illustrate basics of ggplot2 + plyr, in the context of a exploration of the housing crisis in the bay area.  (Plus taste of what's next)

Intro to data.
Little bit about collection.

Basic plots:
  * scatterplot of lat vs long
    * counts (ideal, then actual)
    * overlays
  * histogram of year
  
  * how can we combine them? how do we add extra attributes? 
    how are year and location related?
    
    * scatterplot + facetting
    * scatterplot + summary + aesthetics
    
  * time series
  
Plyr
  * deseasonalise, smooth, index
  * faceting
  

Pointer to beautiful data, ggplot2 books.
